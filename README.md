# Fruit Ninja automation
By using specific setup, this will level you up very quicky. It took a few hours to reach 100 Ultimate.

## Setup
### On Mobile
A hacked client is required for this. Unless, I am going to write a bot which plays the game for you. 
You need to set your current score to about 20,000,000 and lock it. This way, you get at least 1,500 exp every time. 
All you need to do is to end the game very quickly. Classic mode is the best to do this. The fifth wave is a bomb and the game ends there. 
By using the 2x exp blade, the bomb will gravitate towards the blade. By simply holding the screen, the game can end automatically.

### On Computer
Some sort of mirror software is needed. For Android, `scrcpy` can be used and for iOS, I use `Wormhole` but it is paid. Run the python script and you should be all good.

### Python
- Install `Python3`
- Install `virtualenv` (optional)
- `pip install -r requirement.txt`
- `python3 automation.py`
- Follow instructions

You may need to adjust some variables for this to work. Only tested on Windows 10 with Wormhole and iPad Pro 10.5 inch.

## NEET
It might be fun to train an AI to learn how to play fruit ninja but it is not easy. Might be something to do when I am bored.
